# Title & description

## My topic

### Prerequisites

1. we have access to clinical pharmacogenomic findings that are directed at
   field professionals
2. we have access to patient's / user's personal genome

### What i wanna do

- process (1.) to make it machine readable
- use gained structured data and (2.) to make the personally relevant bits of
  it comprehensible / accessible to patients

## Finding a title

### Expressions that could be in it

- processing
- clinical pharmacogenomic findings directed at professionals
- machine readability
- comprehension / comprehensibility / accessibility for patients

### Expressions that shouldn't be in it

- natural language processing
- artificial intelligence
