# Annotation Interface

This chapter describes the conceptualization, implementation, and expert testing
of a new component of the PharMe system: the Annotation Interface. The
Annotation Interface aims to solve the issues discussed in Chapter \ref{as-eval}
by improving the overall experience and efficiency of the process of
researching and curating \glspl{annotation} and maintaining the Annotation
Server's data.

The core idea of the Annotation Interface is to give full control over data to
the curating party, eliminating the communication overhead and the need for a
second party involved in data maintenance. Moreover, the Annotation Interface
conceptualizes and partly implements automation into the curating party's
research and curation process to further increase efficiency. Finally, it
implements an approach towards operating PharMe with support for multiple
languages by modularizing \glspl{annotation}.
