# Annotation Interface

Concerning the main research aim of this thesis, I will propose, implement and
test a new component of the PharMe system: the Annotation Interface. With the
Annotation Interface I will attempt to solve the issues discussed in chapter
\ref{as-eval} by improving the overall experience and efficiency of the process
of curating \glspl{annotation} and maintaining the Annotation Server's data.

The core idea of the Annotation Interface is to give full control over data to
the curating party, eliminating the communication overhead and the need for a
second party involved in maintenance of data. On top of this, I will
conceptualize and partly implement automation into the curating party's research
and curation process to further increase efficiency. Finally, I will implement
an approach towards operating PharMe with support for multiple languages by
modularizing \glspl{annotation}.
