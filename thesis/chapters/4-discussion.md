# Discussion

- what's next & missing for anni
  - handle missing (deleted) Bricks, missing translations
  - open issues
  - what to abstract more
  - touch on possibility to include NLP again
- anni and AS should ideally not be separate (was good in my case anyways)
- support multiple languages in other parts of PharMe system
- feedback from aniwaa
  - benefiting from with Epic's SmartPhrases to make learning anni easier for
    pharmacologists
  - sophisticated production features (staging, history, etc.) necessary for
    real-world use
  - other points would be rather simple to implement
  - make connection with research aim and how it was met
