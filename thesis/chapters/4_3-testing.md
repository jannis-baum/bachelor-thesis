## Testing with an expert

- setup: video call
  - introduction to anni
  - me clicking what she tells me to click to simulate usage test without
    deployment
  - worked through 4 "real" scenarios to get comprehensive feedback and have
    aniwaa get to know anni
- indicate her statements (stumpf)
  - overall perceived as "very user-friendly" and "great annotation tool"
  - learned the UI quickly and without confusion
  - liked displayed CPIC data ("avoids using two screen i.e. CPIC and anni")
    - would be cool to include DPWG guidelines as well
  - question about updating individual CPIC guidelines
  - Bricks
    - comparison with Epic's templates and SmartPhrases
    - should get names/keys, maybe even just numbers (curators will memorize
      them with time)
    - need search bar for annotation and Brick editing
  - in production setting
    - revision history (e.g. for when there is a complaint about data from a
      specific day)
    - staging
    - reviewing changes, have to be approved by other curator(s) before upload
    - summary pages, i.e. "This is what it'll look like in the app"
