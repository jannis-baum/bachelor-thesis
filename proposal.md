# Processing natural language in pharmacogenomic guidelines to facilitate access for non-professionals

## Research Proposal (subject to change)

Latest pharmacogenomic (PGx) guidelines are publicly available through organizations such as PharmGKB and CPIC, which collect and curate findings and make them accessible through their websites and open APIs.
Given these resources along with personal PGx-oriented genotyping or genome sequencing results, an individual is technically enabled to take the findings into consideration in making decisions about their intake of medications.
In reality, an insurmountable barrier that persists even for most individuals aware of PGx is their insufficient ability to comprehend the large volume of available resources:
generalized information is directed at field professionals without any apparent intention of personally targeting patients or non-professionals.

This bachelor’s thesis aims to examine and lower said barrier.
The proposed process starts by assessing the data provided by the before-mentioned APIs, which consists of semi-structured, machine-readable data along with text in the form of technical jargon natural language.
The intent of this assessment is the inference of fully machine-readable data.
The inferred machine-readable data is then further processed for human comprehensibility, and more specifically to facilitate access to people who are not professionals in the field of pharmacogenomics or even medicine or health.
Additionally, a target individual’s available genetic data is taken into consideration to filter available resources for what is personally relevant to said individual.
