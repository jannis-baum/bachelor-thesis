	abstract = {Clinical genetic testing has grown substantially over the past 30 years as the causative mutations for Mendelian diseases have been identiﬁed, particularly aided in part by the recent advances in molecular-based technologies. Importantly, the adoption of new tests and testing strategies (e.g., diagnostic conﬁrmation, prenatal testing, and population-based carrier screening) has often been met with caution and careful consideration before clinical implementation, which facilitates the appropriate use of new genetic tests. Although the ﬁeld of pharmacogenetics was established in the 1950s, clinical testing for constitutional pharmacogenetic variants implicated in interindividual drug response variability has only recently become available to help clinicians guide pharmacotherapy, in part due to {US} Food and Drug Administration-mediated product insert revisions that include pharmacogenetic information for selected drugs. However, despite pharmacogenetic associations with adverse outcomes, physician uptake of clinical pharmacogenetic testing has been slow. Compared with testing for Mendelian diseases, pharmacogenetic testing for certain indications can have a lower positive predictive value, which is one reason for underutilization. A number of other barriers remain with implementing clinical pharmacogenetics, including clinical utility, professional education, and regulatory and reimbursement issues, among others. This review presents some of the current opportunities and challenges with implementing clinical pharmacogenetic testing. Genet Med 2011:13(12):987–995.},

	abstract = {Abstract
            Pharmacogenomics ({PGx}) studies how individual gene variations impact drug response phenotypes, which makes {PGx}-related knowledge a key component towards precision medicine. A significant part of the state-of-the-art knowledge in {PGx} is accumulated in scientific publications, where it is hardly reusable by humans or software. Natural language processing techniques have been developed to guide experts who curate this amount of knowledge. But existing works are limited by the absence of a high quality annotated corpus focusing on {PGx} domain. In particular, this absence restricts the use of supervised machine learning. This article introduces {PGxCorpus}, a manually annotated corpus, designed to fill this gap and to enable the automatic extraction of {PGx} relationships from text. It comprises 945 sentences from 911 {PubMed} abstracts, annotated with {PGx} entities of interest (mainly gene variations, genes, drugs and phenotypes), and relationships between those. In this article, we present the corpus itself, its construction and a baseline experiment that illustrates how it may be leveraged to synthesize and summarize {PGx} knowledge.},
