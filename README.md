# Bachelor thesis

This is the repository for my bachelor thesis at [HPI](https://hpi.de) at the
chair [Digital Health - Personalized
Medicine](https://hpi.de/en/research/research-groups/digital-health-personalized-medicine.html)
and in correspondence with the project
[PharMe](https://github.com/hpi-dhc/PharMe/tree/bbb9595).

## Document setup

The majority of this thesis is written in Markdown with the help of
[Pandoc](https://pandoc.org) and the [OSM LaTex thesis
template](https://gitlab.com/hpi-potsdam/osm/thesis-template).

With Pandoc installed, you can run `make` to compile the thesis PDF.
