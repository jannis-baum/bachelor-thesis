# Processing clinical pharmacogenomic findings to facilitate personalized access for non-professionals

## Abstract (subject to change)

Latest pharmacogenomic research is publicly available through organizations such as PharmGKB and CPIC, which collect and curate findings and make them accessible through their websites and open APIs.
Given these resources along with personal PGx-oriented genotyping or genome sequencing results, an individual is technically enabled to take the findings into consideration in making decisions about their intake of medications.
In reality, an insurmountable barrier that persists even for most individuals aware of PGx is their insufficient ability to comprehend the large volume of available resources:
generalized information is directed at field professionals without any apparent intention of personally targeting patients or non-professionals.

This bachelor's thesis aims to examine and lower said barrier.
The proposed process starts by assessing the available semi-structured data (i.e. structured, machine readable data along with text in form of technical jargon natural language) the before-mentioned APIs provide.
The intent of this assessment is the inference of fully machine-readable data.
The inferred machine readable data is then further processed for human-comprehensibility, and more specifically to facilitate access to people who are not professionals in the field of pharmacogenomics or even medicine or health.
Additionally, a target individual's available genetic data is taken into consideration to personalize their results and hence to reduce reports to relevant information.
