## Processing clinical pharmacogenomic findings for personalized accessibility to non-professionals

### Abstract (subject to change)

\justifying

Latest pharmacogenomic research is publicly available through organizations such as PharmGKB and CPIC, which collect and curate findings and make them accessible through their websites and open APIs. Given these resources along with personal PGx-oriented genotyping or genome sequencing results, an individual is technically enabled to take the findings into consideration in making decisions about their intake of medications. In reality, an insurmountable barrier that persists even for most individuals aware of PGx is the inability to comprehend the available resources: Information is directed at professionals of the field without any apparent intention of targeting patients or, more generally, non-professionals.

This bachelor's thesis aims to examine and lower said barrier. The proposed process starts by assessing the available semi-structured data (i.e. structured, machine readable data along with text in form of technical jargon natural language) the before-mentioned APIs provide. The intent of this assessment is the inference of fully machine-readable data. The inferred machine readable data will then be further processed for human-comprehensibility, and more specifically accessibility to people who are not professionals in the field of pharmacogenomics or even medicine or health. Additionally, the target individual's available genetic data will be taken into consideration to personalize their results and therefore constrain presentation to relevant information.
